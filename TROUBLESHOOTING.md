# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Device Discovery Errors

#### Error: "‚ùå API format error. Please try refreshing the page and logging in again."
**Cause**: Content-Type mismatch with Tuya API
**Solution**: 
- Refresh the page and log in again
- The system will automatically try alternative content types
- Check browser console for detailed error logs

#### Error: "üåê Network connection issue. Please check your internet connection and try again."
**Cause**: Network connectivity problems or API timeout
**Solution**:
- Check your internet connection
- Wait a few seconds and click "Refresh Devices" again
- The system automatically retries up to 3 times

#### Error: "üö´ Too many requests. Please wait a moment before trying again."
**Cause**: Tuya API rate limiting (max 1 request per 3 minutes)
**Solution**:
- Wait 3 minutes before trying again
- The countdown timer will show remaining wait time
- This is a Tuya API limitation, not a bug

### 2. Login Issues

#### Error: "üö´ Rate limit exceeded!"
**Cause**: Too many login attempts in short time
**Solution**:
- Wait for the countdown timer to complete
- Tuya allows only 1 login attempt per 3 minutes
- Check your credentials before attempting again

#### Error: "‚ùå Authentication expired. Please log in again."
**Cause**: Session token has expired
**Solution**:
- Log in again with your credentials
- Sessions typically last 24 hours
- Check if your Tuya account is still active

### 3. Device Control Issues

#### Error: "‚ùå Device control error"
**Cause**: Device offline or API communication failure
**Solution**:
- Check if the device is online in the Tuya app
- Ensure your internet connection is stable
- Try refreshing the device list first

### 4. Performance Issues

#### Slow Device Discovery
**Cause**: Network latency or API response time
**Solution**:
- The system automatically retries failed requests
- Check your internet connection speed
- Consider using a wired connection for better stability

#### App Not Responding
**Cause**: Multiple simultaneous requests or heavy operations
**Solution**:
- Wait for current operations to complete
